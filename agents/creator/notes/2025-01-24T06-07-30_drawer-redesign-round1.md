# Creator Round 1: Drawer Sliding Mechanism Redesign

## Current Issues Identified
- Drawer overlaps chat content even when chat is pushed left
- Z-index conflicts between fixed positioned drawer and relative chat
- Complex translation calculations creating visual artifacts
- Handle moves with chat instead of staying fixed to drawer

## New Design Philosophy: Natural Layout Flow
Instead of fighting positioning, work WITH the browser's natural layout:

1. **Container Grid Approach**: Make the entire app container responsive to drawer state
2. **Smooth Transitions**: Both chat and drawer animate together as a cohesive unit  
3. **Handle Attachment**: Handle stays with drawer, not chat
4. **Behind-the-Scenes**: Drawer truly slides from behind, not over

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. App Container Grid Modification
```css
.app-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 0fr; /* Chat takes full width, drawer takes no space */
  transition: grid-template-columns 400ms ease;
}

.app-container.drawer-open {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 380px; /* Chat shrinks, drawer gets space */
}
```

### 2. Drawer as True Grid Column
- Drawer becomes second grid column instead of fixed overlay
- Handle positioned relative to drawer column, not chat
- Natural stacking order without z-index conflicts

### 3. Smooth Handle Behavior
- Handle travels with drawer as it opens/closes
- Icon direction indicates current state
- No jarring position jumps

## Visual Experience Goals
- Drawer appears to slide out from behind chat's right edge
- Chat content gracefully reflows to accommodate drawer
- Handle feels physically attached to drawer mechanism
- Observatory aesthetic maintained throughout animation

## Next: Implement this grid-based approach and test with Playwright
